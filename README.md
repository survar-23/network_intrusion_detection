# network_intrusion_detection
In this repository, we will use ML model to detect the network intrusion. 

Business Overview:

The increasing use of computer networks and applications has brought network security into sharp focus. Security vulnerabilities persist in computer systems, necessitating the importance of effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). IDSs are specialized devices designed to detect anomalies and potential attacks within a network.

Project Objectives:

Binomial Classification: Detect anomalies by predicting whether the network activity is normal or indicative of an attack.
Multinomial Classification: Identify specific types of activities, including normal behavior or potential attacks like Back, Buffer Overflow, FTP Write, Guess Password, Neptune, N-Map, Port Sweep, Root Kit, Satan, or Smurf.

Available Data:

Organization captured the data over the period of time for different types of attacks and provided
the data in different files for different type of activities along with normal.

There are tables for different type of attacks with same columns

a. Data_of_Attack_Back_Normal

b. Data_of_Attack_Back

c. Data_of_Attack_Back_BufferOverflow

d. Data_of_Attack_Back_FTPWrite

e. Data_of_Attack_Back_GuessPassword

f. Data_of_Attack_Back_Neptune

g. Data_of_Attack_Back_NMap

h. Data_of_Attack_Back_PortSweep

i. Data_of_Attack_Back_RootKit

j. Data_of_Attack_Back_Satan

k. Data_of_Attack_Back_Smurf
